# Rule Templates

Rule templates are optional automated functions that either:

* Edits the row data coming from a [Data Source](../../data-sources.md)  or&#x20;
* Display highlights based on the data or change the data before it is displayed (see [Rule legend](./#rule-legend))

Please make sure to review [Rule Template Fundamentals](../) before continuing on to [Rule Template Parameters](../advanced-scripting.md).

Rules are grouped by two major types: &#x20;

* [Import/Export Rules](import-export/) and&#x20;
* [Display Rules](display/).&#x20;

Import and export rules are considered data transformation rules and replaces the value of the cell with a new value.
