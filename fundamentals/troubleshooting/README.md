# Troubleshooting

Welcome to SharpSync troubleshooting section.

{% hint style="success" %}
First and foremost:&#x20;

* Exercise patience when troubleshooting. While the software is easy to use from the front end (a user's perspective) it has many moving parts with complicated under-the-hood logic. Patience is your friend.
* Take an interative approach, starting with smaller BOMs and working your way up to bigger BOMs.
* Take an interative approach, starting with few property mappings and working your way up to more.
* Make contact with us if you don't understand a message or situation.
* Make contact with us if you would like clarity or support.
* Log a support ticket for any bugs or feature requests. We look at and evaluate all requests.
