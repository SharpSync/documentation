# What Is SharpSync

#### **SharpSync is BOM synchronization done right!**

Cloud-based. Easy setup. Transparent pricing. The days of tedious, expensive, and slow pathways between your engineering and business departments are over. You’re an agile, modern business. Here’s your CAD-ERP link to match.

<figure><img src="https://sharpsync.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/SharpSync_Home_Banner-1200x313.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You have a lot of design data in your CAD (or PDM, or PLM) system that you need to move to your ERP system on a recurring basis.

Manual transfer of this data is slow, repetitive, and prone to human error.

Instead of employing a full-time data-entry technician to transfer this data, SharpSync will help you automate this process and reduce errors to zero by implementing your own rules that match your business logic.

SharpSync was designed from the ground up to be used by users of the application, not to be silo'ed to the halls of developers.
{% endhint %}

#### Easily connect your sources

SharpSync lets you assign your own (Primary / CAD) and (Secondary / ERP) sources from the list of supported sources, configure connection and authentication settings, and connect with the click of a button.

#### Unlimited property mappings

{% hint style="info" %}
You should be able to map your own mappings. Not pay a developer to do it.
{% endhint %}

Property Mappings are SharpSync's way to let you connect matching fields from your sources.&#x20;

SharpSync lets you map unlimited mappings, be it mapping the same CAD field to many ERP fields or vice versa, and even create a mapping with only one source field if you want visibility on certain source fields that do not have their counterpart in the other source.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-10 at 11.01.28 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

SharpSync is able to fetch your sources' native fields dynamically to use in mapping creation.

SharpSync also fetches user created source fields, simply update your SharpSync source fields anytime you create or modify your custom source fields.

SharpSync lets you discretely apply settings per individual mapping, for example, if you want to update only one of the sources value for that particular mapping, or change how the values are rendered for the mapping.

SharpSync supports regular text, checkboxes, and simple and advanced lists to name a few.

#### Make your own rules

SharpSync lets you add rules per mapping to help you transform or control the quality of your data to match your business' needs.

SharpSync categorizes rules that format or manipulate data coming in or going out as Import/Export rules, rules that validate display data based on logical conditions as Display rules, and rules that automate a BOM's submittal conditions as Comparison rules.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2025-11-10 at 13.02.01 PM [2].png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can select from simple pre-formatted rules or script your own advanced script rules using javascript.

You can even create rules that construct values from the data coming from other fields since SharpSync's rules have access to values related to the other defined mappings.

#### Work on simultaneous BOMS

When you export a BOM from your CAD source, a virtual representation of the BOM is added to your SharpSync BOMs page with top level data, such as the name, configuration, and submittal status indicators.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-10 at 12.13.26 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

SharpSync lets you add as many BOMs as you want and work on them simultaneously.

#### View and edit your BOM data

The first time you click on a BOM, SharpSync automatically starts the process of loading the structure and components metadata from the sources, then superposes the data in a user friendly, hierarchical and colour-coded tabular format.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2025-11-10 at 12.09.31 PM [2] (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
The BOM legend is your quick reference for any colour-coded information or operation.
{% endhint %}

In general, row background colours are associated with a hierarchy operation: Item to create, Item to unlink from BOM. etc...

{% hint style="info" %}
SharpSync will never delete an item from your ERP source.
{% endhint %}

Cell border colours are associated with a cell value or a rule failure. For example, different source values for the same mapping or values that fail to meet the rule conditions.

A failing value will warn you or block you from submitting a BOM until the value is modified to meet the rule condition.

You can edit values just like you do in any spreadsheet type software, simply double clivk and edit text, or select from a list of available values.

#### Inspect your own setup

SharpSync provides you with a BOM Rules panel at the individual cell level to help you visualize and troubleshoot your data's journey from when it is fetched from the source, the rules it is subject to, and any transformations (changes) prior to sending it back to the source for update.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2025-11-10 at 12.48.33 PM [2].png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can think of SharpSync as your gatekeeper that can even ensure that your source data has been originally modelled according to your own business rules.

#### Submit BOMs for source update

Once you are satisfied with your changes, simply click on the BOM submit button, the sources update data is sent server-side and will run in the background.

At this point, the web page can safely be closed and visited later later when the update process is complete.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2025-11-10 at 15.00.01 PM [2].png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

SharpSync will also generate a BOM submittal report should it encounter any warnings or errors during the update process.
