# User Management

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/section_header_users.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Section: Users</p></figcaption></figure>

Managing users in SharpSync is easy to understand and use.



There are 3 types of users:

* Administrators
* Editors
* Viewers

Their respective capabilities are listed in the [Application Permissions ](application-permissions.md)section.



Adding users are easy. To add a new user:

* Navigate to the `User` section
* Enter the Name & email address
* Click the `Invite User`button

A verification email will be sent to a user asking them to join your organization.

If they did not receive it or it was filtered out, there is a `Resend Invite`button to re-invite the user.



From this screen an administrator can Edit a user's email address or Display Name, or remove the user from the organization.
