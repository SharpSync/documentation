# CSV

CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are utilized to import Bills of Materials (BOMs) from desktop-based CAD software such as SolidWorks, Inventor, SolidEdge or similar into SharpSync. Follow the steps below to begin importing data into SharpSync using CSV files.

### Prerequisites

* Ensure your CSV output is complete.
* CSVs should contain BOM data only.
* Columns can be empty, but row data must not exceed the number of columns.
* BOMs should be exported in an indented or structured format to encapsulate an assembly's hierarchy.
* Flattened BOMs are not recommended.
* For best results, ensure that the CSV is in UTF-8 format.
