# Common setup

The pages below show common setup scenarios. It is by no means exhaustive, but we've found these helpful.

* [Configure Accounts selection](configure-accounts-mappings.md)
* [Configure Item Type mapping](item-type-mapping.md)
* [Configure New assemblies as `isPhantom`](configure-isphantom-mapping.md)
* [Configure subsidiary selection](configure-subsidiary-mapping.md)
* [Configure a thumbnail folder](broken-reference)
* [Configure a `where-used`link](configure-where-used-link-mapping.md)

#### Caveats

Subsidiary is not available for all setups. When using advanced BOMs + routings you have access to subsidiaries.
