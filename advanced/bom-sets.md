After exporting a BOM Set from a supported Primary DataSource, a BOM Set card will appear in the BOM Sets page.

The related configurations of a BOM Set will start loading automatically in the background. And can be viewed by navigating to the individual BOM Set page by clinking on the BOM Set name or the navigation arrow.

Once all configurations have been loaded with Onshape Load Status of  `loadCompleted` , a zip file containing a CSV file per configuration can be downloaded by clicking on the "Download CSVs" button.

Column headers of BOM configuration CSV files represent the Display Names of the primary Data Source fields / properties as setup in the Property Mappings and their order is determined by the existing sort order of the mappings.&#x20;
